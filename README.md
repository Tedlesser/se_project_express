# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

A server for the WTWR What to wear application. A database, set up with security and postman testing, that is deployable to web applications on a remote machine. This server will innevitably allow the front end client to access it's API and user authorization, to save personalized information that can be stored about the user and the user account. To make this happen, MongDB was used to create a database, and REST API was used to handle information that is creatable, readable, updateable, and deleteable on the server. We also used node.js which was used for server-side development, and express as the Javascript framework for developing the code that governs the server's logic.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
